# Eigenface Algorithm

*Created for our Math 214 Final Project: "Eigenfaces as a Method of Compression and Recognition for Face"*

`algo.py` contains the eigenface facial recognition algorithm, and `model_stats.py` computes accuracy statistics for our model.

`lfwcrop_grey/` contains the LFWcrop dataset used to train and test our model.
